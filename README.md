This is the online repository for the literature review paper on Karma.


## Contents of the repository
It contains following files that are the result of topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the literature corpus:

- **LiteratureCorpus.xlsx** contains a list of all papers that were found and considered in this study.
- **LDA_Topic_Word_Lists.xlsx** contains a list of manually selected words from the top 100 words for each topic.
- **LDA_Topic_Word_matrix.xlsx** and **LDA_Topic_Document_matrix.xlsx** contain the probability matrixes that connect topics with words respectively topics with documents.
- **models/** is a folder containing the rendered topic models from multiple runs with different seeds (topic models can be loaded with [tomotopy](https://bab2min.github.io/tomotopy/v0.7.1/en/) from a ZIP file, which is too big to be uploaded here, but available upon request from the authors)
